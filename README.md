# 💬 ChatFi – The Conversational Web3 AI Agent

**ChatFi** is an intelligent, WhatsApp-based AI agent that brings decentralized finance (DeFi), NFT management, and real-world insights from drone imagery directly into the hands of users — using nothing more than natural language and their mobile phone.

Powered by the **Flow blockchain** and secured with **Filecoin**, ChatFi is designed to make the decentralized web accessible, personal, and truly mobile-first.

## 🔍 Vision

The world of Web3 is powerful — but often inaccessible. Most people don't interact with smart contracts, swap tokens, stake assets, or mint NFTs because these actions are hidden behind complex interfaces and unfamiliar terminology.

**ChatFi reimagines this** by offering a simple, intuitive way to access these capabilities:  
👉 **a conversation**.

ChatFi is your on-demand Web3 assistant — fully autonomous, memory-aware, and always available on WhatsApp.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 💸 Conversational DeFi Management

ChatFi acts as your personal finance manager in the decentralized world. You can ask it to:
- **Send FLOW or USDFC tokens** to another wallet
- **Swap tokens** using DEX integrations
- **Stake assets** for passive yield
- **Check your portfolio**, balances, or historical transactions
- **Interact with DAOs** — vote on proposals, donate, or delegate

All via messages like:
- *"Send 20 FLOW to @alice"*
- *"What’s my staking APY?"*
- *"Convert 10 USDFC to FLOW"*

No manual wallet interactions. No dApp dashboards. Just chat.

### 🖼 NFT Minting and Management

ChatFi makes NFTs ridiculously simple:
- Snap or upload a photo
- Say *“Mint this as an NFT”*
- Choose a Flow wallet to store it

Behind the scenes, ChatFi stores the media metadata on **Filecoin/IPFS** and executes the minting process on **Flow** — sending you a link to your new collectible.

You can also:
- View your NFTs
- Transfer them
- Get a floor price estimate

### 🧠 AI-Powered Personalization

ChatFi uses cutting-edge natural language processing (LLMs like GPT) to:
- Parse intent from messages
- Ask clarifying questions
- Confirm risky actions before execution
- Learn your preferences over time (e.g. preferred tokens or staking choices)

The agent becomes smarter with each interaction, saving context (securely) and reducing friction across sessions.

### 🌍 DroneSight: Imagery Intelligence Meets Crypto

In partnership with Spexi’s drone ecosystem and Filecoin’s decentralized storage, ChatFi also supports basic **aerial imagery analysis** using an embedded AI vision pipeline.

Users can:
- Upload drone imagery via WhatsApp
- Ask ChatFi to analyze the photo for:
  - Solar panel suitability
  - Building/roof damage
  - Vegetation coverage
  - Flood risk estimation
- Receive:
  - A natural language report
  - Annotated image overlays
  - Optional Filecoin-hosted reports and NFT minting options

This feature is especially powerful for:
- Public works & disaster relief
- Urban development & real estate
- Remote infrastructure inspection

And best of all — it’s powered by lightweight AI models (YOLO, segmentation CNNs) and delivered right in chat.

## 🧩 Modular Architecture

ChatFi is built on a clean, modular pipeline, consisting of:

- **Messaging Interface**: WhatsApp via Twilio or 360Dialog
- **LLM Layer**: Intent parsing and conversation management
- **Wallet Layer**: FLOW SDK for blockchain interactions
- **AI Layer**: For drone image analysis, personalization, and NLP generation
- **Storage Layer**: Filecoin/IPFS for persistent, tamper-proof data

These modules work independently and asynchronously, allowing the system to be upgraded or scaled easily.

## 🔒 Trust, Security & Privacy

- No wallet keys are stored centrally — user signing occurs via secure, ephemeral sessions
- Sensitive media (e.g. drone images, wallet info) are stored only on Filecoin with encryption and hash integrity
- Users can revoke or reset their agent’s memory anytime
- AI outputs are auditable — all decisions/actions are logged for transparency

## 🌐 Use Case Highlights

| Scenario | What ChatFi Does |
|----------|------------------|
| *A user wants to invest in DeFi on Flow* | Recommends safe staking options and executes transactions |
| *A farmer wants to analyze their field via drone photo* | Returns vegetation stats and overlays, stored on Filecoin |
| *An artist mints NFTs from their mobile photo library* | Mints, stores metadata, and provides shareable links |
| *A DAO member wants to vote from their phone* | Lists proposals, confirms voting power, submits on-chain vote |
| *A user wants to swap tokens while commuting* | Parses request, finds best route, executes, and confirms in chat |

## 📈 Potential Extensions

ChatFi is just the beginning. Future versions could support:
- Telegram, Discord, or SMS interfaces
- Multi-chain DeFi access (ETH, Solana, NEAR)
- Agent memory NFTs (portable agent state stored on-chain)
- Voice-activated interactions
- Anonymous ZK-wallet transactions
- Modular agent creation (users build their own ChatFi)
